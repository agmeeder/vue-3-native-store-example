# Example Vue 3 project with a 'store' build with the Composition API

This sample Vue 3 project is build with Vite. It uses the new script-setup option of Vue 3.2:

```js
<script setup>
...
</script>
```

It is inspired by a YouTube video of 'John Komarnicki' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64zoDGcQr10). Most of the code is re-used
 from his Github repo (https://github.com/johnkomarnicki/vue-3-composition-api-state-managment).
 
This code uses much less '**boilerplate code**' and is more '**compositional**'.

## To start the application:
> npm run dev
